# SessionStart hook — keep the MAIN checkout's `main` fresh, the SAFE way.
# See AGENTS.md "Parallel development (worktrees)" and the sibling worktree-reminder.sh.
#
# Why this exists: the requested behaviour was "git pull main on every Edit/Write/Read".
# That is harmful — Read is side-effect-free yet would mutate the tree under you, pull
# would clobber/conflict with the in-progress edit, and on a feature branch it pollutes
# the branch. The safe equivalent of "always keep main latest" is: fast-forward `main`
# to origin/main ONCE per session start, and ONLY when it is a zero-risk fast-forward.
#
# Hard guards (any one → skip, always exit 0, never blocks the session):
#   - not inside a git work tree
#   - inside a linked worktree (do feature work there; never sync its branch to main)
#   - not on the default branch `main`
#   - working tree is dirty (a pull could clobber / conflict with uncommitted work)
#   - `origin/main` is not a fast-forward of local `main` (diverged → resolve manually)
#
# Fast-forwarding the source files is safe for the running prod (prod serves a built
# web/dist + a live node process; FF only updates source — prod restarts only on
# `npm run prod:up`). Output goes to stdout, which SessionStart feeds into context, so
# the next turn knows main moved and won't reason against a stale tree.

# Only act inside a git work tree.
