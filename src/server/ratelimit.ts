/** Best-effort client identity for rate-limiting.
 *
 * By default this uses the TCP socket address (req.socket.remoteAddress), which is
 * unforgeable but returns the proxy's IP when the server runs behind a reverse proxy —
 * making rate-limiting ineffective (all requests share one bucket).
 *
 * Set TRUST_PROXY=true in .env when running behind a single trusted reverse proxy (nginx,
 * Caddy, Railway, cloud load-balancer) that rewrites the client-IP headers. Only enable this
 * when you control the proxy; never enable it when the server is directly internet-facing, as
 * clients could otherwise inject arbitrary X-Real-IP / X-Forwarded-For headers.
 *
 * When trusted, we prefer X-Real-IP (a single clean value the proxy sets to the real client and
 * overwrites if forged), and fall back to the FIRST X-Forwarded-For hop (the proxy puts the real
 * client at the front and strips any client-supplied XFF).
 *
 * Verified empirically against Railway (getworkora.com's proxy): a request carrying a forged
 * `X-Real-IP` AND a forged `X-Forwarded-For` arrived with both rewritten — X-Real-IP held the
 * true client IP and the forged XFF entries were dropped, leaving the real client leftmost.
 * Railway *prepends* the real client and *appends* its own (rotating) edge hop, so the RIGHTMOST
 * XFF entry is the proxy's edge IP — using it as the rate-limit key gives every request a fresh
 * bucket and defeats the limit entirely.
 *
 * NB: this assumes the proxy overwrites/prepends these headers (Railway; nginx with
 * `proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr`). A proxy that blindly *appends* a client-supplied
 * XFF would leave the leftmost spoofable. Multi-hop chains (CDN → nginx → app) need hop-count-aware
 * parsing (e.g. proxy-addr) — outside the scope of this single-trusted-hop implementation.
 *
 * Note: this server uses node:http directly (not Express), so there is no framework-level
 * trust proxy setting — the decision is explicit via this env flag. */
