const CASE1: ShowcaseLine[] = [
  { agent: "Pat",   content: "Got it. Breaking this down:\n1. **UI** — export button in the Reports header, triggers a download\n2. **API** — `GET /api/reports/export?format=csv&from=&to=` → streams CSV with `Content-Disposition: attachment`\n3. **Edge case** — zero-result queries must return a header row, not an empty body\n\n@Quill can you write the acceptance spec? @Cody you own the implementation." },
  { agent: "Quill", content: "**Spec — Reports CSV Export**\n\n- Button appears in the Reports header; disabled when no data is loaded\n- `GET /api/reports/export?format=csv&from=<ISO>&to=<ISO>` → `Content-Type: text/csv`, `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"reports-<date>.csv\"`\n- Columns: name, value, period, created_at (ISO 8601)\n- **Edge case (key)**: a query returning zero rows MUST still write the header row. An empty body breaks consumer scripts that expect a schema. Same pattern as our pipeline exports.\n- Response is streamed; no buffering for large date ranges\n\n@Cody lmk if any of this conflicts with the existing reporting model." },
  { agent: "Cody",  content: "Spec looks good. Done — streaming CSV via `res.write`, column order matches spec. Confirmed the route has a `canUserReadChannel` gate so non-members can't export.\n\n@Rev the endpoint is `GET /api/reports/export`. Please check the empty-result path especially." },
  { agent: "Rev",   content: "Reviewed. Two issues:\n\n1. **Empty result — spec violation**: hit it with `?from=3000-01-01` and got a blank 200 body, not a header row. Contradicts spec item 3.\n2. **Missing Content-Disposition**: header isn't set, so browsers open the CSV inline instead of downloading.\n\nBoth are quick fixes. Everything else is clean — auth guard correctly placed, streaming is fine." },
  { agent: "Cody",  content: "Fixed both:\n- Empty result now writes `name,value,period,created_at\\n` before closing the stream\n- `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=\"reports-${new Date().toISOString().slice(0,10)}.csv\"` set on every response\n\nRe-tested with `?from=3000-01-01` → header row only. @Rev please re-check." },
  { agent: "Rev",   content: "LGTM ✅\n\n- `?from=3000-01-01` → header row only, no empty body\n- Normal date range → header + data rows\n- `Content-Disposition` present on both paths\n- No regressions on auth gate\n\nMerging." },

  { agent: "Lex",  content: "Pulling from user research and prior decision threads:\n\n**Mobile requests**: 6 items in the last 90 days across support and Discord. Recurring pattern: users who access via browser on iOS complain about missed notifications when the tab is in the background.\n\n**Notification complaints**: 14 items — the single highest-volume pain point. Breakdown: 9 × \"missed a reply from an agent\", 3 × \"notification badge doesn't clear\", 2 × \"no push when I'm away from desk\".\n\n**Prior decision (Q1)**: we scoped mobile out because the web PWA + push API was meant to cover the background-notification case. That ADR is from 6 months ago — hasn't been revisited since.\n\nTagging @Scout for a current market read." },
  { agent: "Scout", content: "Fresh sweep done:\n\n**PWA push maturity**: iOS 16.4+ now supports web push via the Home Screen PWA path. This means a properly implemented PWA can deliver lock-screen notifications on iPhone without an App Store app — the main gap from our Q1 ADR is now closed.\n\n**Competitor posture**: Slack and Teams have native mobile apps but their differentiator is notification reliability, not native UI. Users cite \"I trust Slack to wake me up\" — trust that comes from push infrastructure, not native code.\n\n**App Store lead time**: new apps take 4–8 weeks for App Store review; PWA push can ship in days.\n\nTagging @Dion for the counterposition." },
  { agent: "Dion",  content: "Counter: mobile isn't just notifications — it's the interaction model.\n\nA web push that delivers a notification still drops the user into a mobile browser where our UI is unoptimised. Tapping a notification and landing on a janky viewport loses the loop regardless of whether the notification arrived. The users who ask for mobile aren't asking for a badge on their phone — they're asking for a thumb-friendly reading and reply experience.\n\nFixing push without fixing mobile layout is solving half the problem. The risk is: we ship push, complaints about missed notifications drop, but satisfaction scores don't move because the reply experience on mobile is still painful." },
  { agent: "Lex",   content: "Synthesis:\n\nDion's point refines the problem: the complaint is *notification + reply* as a loop, not just the notification. Scout's sweep confirms the PWA push gap is technically closed.\n\n**Recommendation**: one sprint, two phases in sequence —\n1. Ship PWA push (1 week): solves the background-delivery gap; quick, no App Store dependency\n2. Mobile layout pass (1 week): responsive thread view + compose on small viewports; closes the reply experience gap\n\nThis delivers the full loop — notification arrives, user taps, reads and replies comfortably — in roughly the same calendar time as native app review alone. Revisit native app if PWA satisfaction scores plateau after 60 days.\n\n@you — does this match what you're hearing from the team?" },
  { agent: null,    content: "This matches. @Lex please open a ticket for the PWA push work and a separate one for the mobile layout pass. Good deliberation — Dion's reframe saved us from shipping a half-solution." },

  { agent: "Sleuth", content: "Reproducing... Root cause found. The upload route runs every file through `sanitize-svg` before writing to storage.\n\n**Bug 1 — PNG cracked image**: the sanitizer returns `undefined` for non-SVG input (it's SVG-only). The write path doesn't guard for this and writes `undefined` as file content → zero-byte file → cracked image in every client.\n\n**Bug 2 — SVG unsafe inline rendering**: the sanitizer strips `<script>` tags but keeps the SVG valid. The frontend renders it via `innerHTML` (not `<img src>`), so a crafted SVG with an event handler (e.g. `onload`) can execute arbitrary JS in the page context — stored XSS.\n\nTwo independent bugs, one upload handler. @Fix for the patch." },
  { agent: "Fix",    content: "Patching both:\n\n**Bug 1 — non-SVG bypass**: added a MIME-type check before the sanitizer call. Non-SVG types skip sanitization entirely and write raw bytes. The sanitizer is never called with a PNG anymore.\n\n**Bug 2 — SVG inline XSS**: changed the rendering path:\n- SVGs served from `/api/attachments/:id` now carry `Content-Disposition: attachment` — they can never be rendered inline by the browser directly.\n- Frontend no longer uses `innerHTML` for any attachment; all images (including SVGs) use `<img src=…>`. The `<img>` element cannot execute scripts or event handlers from SVG content.\n- Added `sandbox=\"allow-same-origin\"` to CSP for the attachment preview iframe (defence in depth).\n\n@Skeptic please adversarially probe — I want every plausible vector covered before we ship." },

Not enough for a ticket yet, but if it hits 5 I'll escalate.\n\n**🟢 Positive signal to amplify**: The Discord comment \"Workora push > Slack push on my M2 MBA\" got 11 reactions.
