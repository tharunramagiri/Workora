// One-off, idempotent migration: remove the legacy DB-backed showcase demo data after the showcase
// moved to a static front-end page (web/src/views/Showcase.tsx + web/src/showcaseData.ts — zero DB).
//
// Deletes, in one transaction:
//   • every type='showcase' channel + the thread channels derived from its anchor messages
//   • all messages in those channels + their message_mentions / reactions / saved_messages / attachments
//   • every creator_type='system' prop agent (the per-workspace demo cast — Pat/Cody/Alice/…)
// Attachment blobs are removed from object storage on a best-effort basis (local unlink / S3 DeleteObject);
// blob failures only warn — the DB is already consistent once the transaction commits.
//
// Idempotent: a second run finds nothing and reports all zeros.
//
// Usage (reads DATABASE_URL from the env, like the server; or pass it as the first arg):
//   node scripts/drop-showcase.mjs
//   node scripts/drop-showcase.mjs "postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db"
//   set -a && . ./.env.prod && set +a && node scripts/drop-showcase.mjs   # prod env (+ S3 blob cleanup)
