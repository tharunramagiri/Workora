# Workora docs site

Public one-page documentation site for [Workora](https://github.com/ramagiritharun/Workora), built with Astro.

The page intentionally avoids a generic docs framework. It uses the warm-editorial visual system from `DESIGN.md` and keeps the first public docs pass focused on one complete path: quickstart, collaboration, agents, machines, self-hosting, runtimes, and the auth model.

The `English` control switches the whole page, including metadata. Do not add a separate Chinese section. Legacy visits to `/#chinese` are redirected to the top and shown in Chinese so old links do not land mid-page.

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Default local URL: `http://localhost:4321`.

## Build

```bash
npm run verify:onepage
npm run build
```

`verify:onepage` checks that the site stays a single custom Astro page, does not reintroduce Starlight, single English page, and does not bring back the old purple/blue default theme.

## Source of truth

This site is a public-facing guide. Implementation contracts still live in the repository:

- `README.md` for the main quickstart and runtime status
- `docs/self-host.md` for production deployment details
- `FEATURES.md` for the capability matrix
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` for the system codemap
- `docs/authorization.md` for auth planes, roles, scopes, and invariants
